# Green Clock

Our five year old kept waking up at 5am and waking us up.

She wasn't very good at reading time or clocks yet.

This small site basically sets an "Okay to Wake" time.

When it's 6am, it turns bright green letting her know she can leave her room and wake us up.

Yes, it's only an extra hour, but every hour counts when you're a parent.

## Run
`npm install`

`npm start`
